This module provides access to runtime environment variables, as defined by the platform you're running on. For example if you're using [`adapter-node`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/adapter-node) (or running [`vite preview`](/docs/kit/cli)), this is equivalent to `process.env`. This module only includes variables that _do not_ begin with [`config.kit.env.publicPrefix`](/docs/kit/configuration#env) _and do_ start with [`config.kit.env.privatePrefix`](/docs/kit/configuration#env) (if configured).

This module cannot be imported into client-side code.

```ts
import { env } from '$env/dynamic/private';
console.log(env.DEPLOYMENT_SPECIFIC_VARIABLE);
```

> [!NOTE] In `dev`, `$env/dynamic` always includes environment variables from `.env`. In `prod`, this behavior will depend on your adapter.
